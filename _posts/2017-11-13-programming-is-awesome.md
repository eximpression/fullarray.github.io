This is just a thought that has floated around in many companies internal development teams. The idea that talented developers are significantly scarce is a reality. But why?. This bold assertion lays in the fact that many to-be developers don't practice as much as their senior counterparts. Another possible reason is that to-be developers are impatient and would like to get up and running in virtually no time. 

The fact that programming is an art is ignored by many, but if a person is to become a developer several hours, days, weeks, and years are needed to reach a comfortable level necessary to perform at a junior and senior developer level.
